# Web Accessibility Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Accessibility is...

The measure of usability by persons with one or more disabilities.

The concept of accessible design ensures both:

- “direct access” — unassisted
- “indirect access” — compatibility with a person's assistive technology

## Categorizing Accessibility

There are four major categories of accessibility:

- Visual (myopia, color blindness, glaucoma, albinism)
- Auditory  (acoustic trauma, auditory processing disorder, otosclerosis)
- Motor (cerebral palsy, parkinson’s, muscular dystrophy)
- Cognitive (down’s syndrome, autism, global developmental delay, dyslexia)
